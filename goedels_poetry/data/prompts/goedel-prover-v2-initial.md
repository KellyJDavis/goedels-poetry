Complete the following Lean 4 code:

```lean4
{{ formal_statement }}```

Before producing the Lean 4 code to formally prove the given theorem, provide a detailed proof plan outlining the main proof steps and strategies.
The plan should highlight key ideas, intermediate lemmas, and proof structures that will guide the construction of the final formal proof.

When you've completed your planning you should output your completion of the Lean 4 code within a ```lean4...``` code block.
